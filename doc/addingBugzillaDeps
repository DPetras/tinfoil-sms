Setting up Bugzilla for android (working progress)

1. Download the neccessary libraries:
    (So far been determined to be)
        - j2bugzilla-2.0.jar
        - commons-logging-1.1.jar
        - ws-commons-util-1.0.2.jar
        - xmlrpc-client-3.1.3.jar
        - xmlrpc-common-3.1.3.jar
        - xmlrpc-server-3.1.3.jar

2. With these, you then need to link them to the android project.

    2.1 Copy the libraries to the 'libs' folder in the android project
    2.2 Open up eclipse.
    2.3 Open the 'libs' folder in the 'Package Explorer'
    2.4 Right click on the libraries and under 'Build Path' click on 'Add To Build Path'
    2.5 Repeat for all libraries
    2.6 Ensure that the libraries are now also showing under a 'Referenced Libraries' in the 'Package Explorer'.

This should do it, try doing a clean all, and then building. If this doesnt work then you may have to undo this and just do it again. (I had this problem)

If you are having problems make sure that you open up the build path (right click the library and click on 'Build Path...' and then on 'Configure Build Path...'
