Tinfoil head Manifesto
----------------------

We here stand as mortal men committed to creating a software application
that will protect the rights and freedom of all men, as all men are created
equal.

We hold the following as inallianable rights of men

+ A right to privacy
+ A right to security
+ A right to cryptography


In addition, we call upon all men to value security above all else, as
security is only as good as the weakest link. Heed the following.

1. Trust no one
2. Design systems with the intent that everyone is acting against the system
3. Security above all else, including performance


We heed the tinfoil hat as a right of passage, as a quick view of
[facebook's privacy mess](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/05/12/business/facebook-privacy.html?ref=personaltech)
will traumatize even the most reserved facebook users.

Take heed of the warnings presented in this document, Tinfoil-SMS is designed with the tinfoilhead[1]
in mind.
